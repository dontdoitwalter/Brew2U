<h1>About Us</h1>
<h3>The Creators</h3>
<p>
    Mitch, Sam and Walter were classmates at an Indianapolis coding academy, grouped together for their final
    project, it seemed like fate brought them together to bring this world a wonderful new innovative idea, in 
    the delivery food service industry.

<h3>What is Brew2U</h3>
<p>
    Brew2U is a cofffee delivery service not unlike GrubHub or UberEats. The concept is simple, the coffee you want, without
    the hassle of doing it yourself. The difference between us and them is that we exclusively deliver coffee, from where ever
    you want, like that little coffee shop that you love that you just don't have time to stop by on your way to work in the
    morning.
