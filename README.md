# Brew2u

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6. Brew2U is a coffee delivery service application that allows the user to create an account and order coffee from their favorite coffee shop and have it delivered to them wherever they may be.

## To Run Locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Open your CLI and navigate to the applications folder
3. Run npm install
4. Run ng update
5. Run ng serve -o to run the application. This should open a web browser on port 4200.
6. Create an account or login.

## To run this application on the web.

1. Launch the app(this should be a link to the deployed client)
2. Click Login/Signup depending on whether you have an account or not (if you created an account locally, you still need to create an      account on this deployed version to login).
3. As a user you are able to update and delete your account, you can also add the beverage(s) you would like to your cart and purchase      for delivery. After ordering a beverage it will appear on your profile as a previously ordered beverage.
